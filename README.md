Mammography plays a crucial role in the early detection of breast cancer. It serves as a primary diagnostic tool for identifying potential abnormalities at an early stage. To enhance diagnostic precision and minimize human errors, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems have been introduced. My research aims to explore mammogram mass segmentation, focusing on computer vision and machine learning methods while avoiding neural networks. Despite their exceptional performance, neural networks demand substantial resources and data, presenting challenges. This approach is not resource intensive and can be used for real-time mass segmentation in CAD systems. 

The steps involved in this process include eliminating background noise through binarization through otsu-thresholding, enhancing images using a unique histogram equalization method, segmenting mammograms with Gaussian Mixture models to isolate crucial patterns, extracting potential abnormalities and filtering false-positives using classification algorithms. Notably, we prioritize sensitivity over specificity, tailored to our applicationâ€™s needs. This thorough exploration into non-neural models intends to provide insights into their effectiveness for mammogram mass segmentation, offering potential resource-efficient alternatives in situations where neural networks are impractical.
